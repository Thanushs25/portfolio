## Projects
- ### Parkinson's Disease Identification using vocal features 
  [Publication](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10085210)
  Developed a *Machine Learning* Model that detects whether the patient is affected by Parkinson's Disease or not by using vocal features of 
  the patient.

- ### Heart Disease Prediction using Machine Learning
Developed a *Machine Learning* Model that detects whether the patient is affected by Cardiovascular Disease or not. Cardiovascular disease, also known as heart disease, has been the primary cause of death globally in recent decades. It encompasses various heart-related conditions and prompt access to reliable and practical techniques for early diagnosis and treatment is crucial due to the many risk factors associated with heart disease.

- ### “Medicinal plants detection, uses and recovery methods” using ConvolutionalNeural Networks (CNN)
Developed a *Deep Learning* Model that classifies the given input image (i.e. image of a medicinal plant) which belongs to which family and specifies its name, medicinal uses, and recovery methods.

- ### Speech Emotion recognition using Deep Learning
Developed a *Deep Learning* Model that classifies the given input audio and its emotion (Eg., disgust, happiness, sad, etc,.)

- ### Song-Genre Classification using Classification Techniques
Developed a *Pyspark MLib* Model that classifies the genres of song.
